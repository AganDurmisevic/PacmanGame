                                            //////// How to Play /////////

               Use arrow keys or (for Multiplay) W,A,S and D to move, Enter to pause, Space for next Lvl.

                                        Here are the parts that I have implemented:
                                        - Eat points and oranges to push your Score.
                                        - Don't get eaten by ghosts or you'll die.

                                               Scoring is as follows:
                                           - 10 pts for each red points
                                             - 40 pts for each orange
